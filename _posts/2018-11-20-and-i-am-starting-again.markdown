description: does it matter?

I am terrified of failing. So instead of participating and having a little chance of success, I back out with 0% chances of success. Below are the instances when I stopped learning because I feared that I will be unable to remember all the things.

In 2010 I made my “Hello World” program(in Java). In early 2013 I came across Codecademy and I realized my love for Computer Science. In one year I almost completed there Javascript course and half completed there HTML5 course. And here comes the first break.

I will do it tomorrow was in my head all the time but tomorrow never came. Then after 6-month, the passion got reignited I made a basic website using only HTML. After completing 70% of the course I stopped because of the fear of failing. Also,I was learning Java in school and was more interested in it so I started learning Python.

By the end of 2014, I knew everything in Python except its heart( object-oriented programming). From then till 3 months (3.5 Years) back I never really understood how object-oriented programming worked.

In the summer of 2015, I also tried my hand in making an Android app and followed (read copied) tutorials and was able to make a tic-tac-toe game and weather reading app. Most of the code was copied and I did not understand the fundamentals so I got BORED.

I did not learn anything new in the next two years but not a single day passed without thinking about coding.

I got admitted BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. After a lot of internal efforts, I resumed coding. In the month of August 2018, I learned python from scratch and completed MIT 6.0.0.1x. Oh by the way, in May 2016 I enrolled into Harvard CS50x which I have not completed yet.

I have not done anything of substance since then so I thought making my motivations public would help me to focus. The thought of “What will other people think about me?” is a real motivator as of now.

So the objective is to write a weekly blog to talk about my progress and lessons learnt. And also to write “Blog”.

Current goals are *Drumrolls*:

* GSOC 2019

* Getting 8.5+ CG in 1st Year
